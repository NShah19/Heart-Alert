# heart_alert
Over 610,000 people in the U.S. suffer from heart attacks or cardiac arrest.
For this project, we made an application that would help people recognize when they have an irregular heartbeat that could lead to a heart condition.
This is a mobile application that allows the user to input their emergency contacts and medical history.
It has two modes a "patient" and a "doctor" mode and the patient is able to send their medical information to the doctor.
It is connected to an Arduino 101 heart rate monitor and sensor.
If the user reaches an abnormal heartbeat, the Arduino 101 sends a bluetooth signal that alerts the user through this mobile application and allows them to call 911 or their emergency contacts.
In addition, their medical info is retrieved from the database and sent to the doctor side of the application.
